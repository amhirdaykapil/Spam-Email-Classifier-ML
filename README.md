# ðŸ“§ Spam Email Classifier

This project is a **machine learning application** that detects whether an email is **SPAM** or **NOT SPAM** based on its content.  

It uses **TF-IDF vectorization** with **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** for classification and has an interactive web app built with **Streamlit**.
